      One Pot Lemon Herb Chicken and Rice is a quick and flavorful dish that
      brings together tender chicken breasts and fluffy rice, all cooked in a
      single pot in just 30 minutes. The recipe begins by browning seasoned
      chicken in butter, then adding rice, chicken broth, lemon juice, and
      Italian herbs to create a zesty and aromatic base. Once the chicken is
      placed back on top, the mixture simmers until the rice is perfectly cooked
      and absorbs all the delicious flavors. This one-pot meal not only
      simplifies cleanup but also makes for excellent leftovers, making it an
      ideal choice for busy weeknights or meal prep. Garnish with fresh parsley
      or lemon wedges for an extra burst of flavor before serving.

            Melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet or pan (one that has

            seasoning. Brown chicken in the butter for 1-2 minutes on each side.
            (Chicken shouldn’t be cooked through at this point) Transfer chicken
            to a plate.

            Add rice, chicken broth, lemon juice, and remaining Italian

    <h2>Cheesy Chicken Broccoli Rice Casserole Recipe!</h2>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Cheesy Chicken Broccoli Rice Casserole is a comforting and easy-to-make
      dish that combines tender chicken, fresh broccoli, and rice in a creamy
      sauce, all topped with a buttery Ritz cracker crust. The recipe begins by
      cooking bite-sized pieces of chicken in butter and seasoning them with
      Italian herbs. After browning the chicken, chicken broth, rice, and
      broccoli are added to the pot and simmered until the rice is tender. The
      mixture is then combined with cream of chicken soup, milk, sour cream, and
      shredded cheddar cheese before being transferred to a casserole dish.
      After a brief baking period to melt the cheese, crushed Ritz crackers
      mixed with melted butter are sprinkled on top and baked until golden
      brown. This casserole can be made ahead of time and is perfect for meal
      prep or freezing for later use, serving about six people in total.

            Note: This recipe is designed to allow you to prepare all of the
            casserole ingredients in one pot before transferring to a casserole
            dish for baking. Before you begin, refer to your rice package for
            the amount of liquid (we'll use chicken broth) and cooking time. I
            use white long grain rice and the cooking time/liquid amount below
            works perfectly.
          </li>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350° F.</li>
          <li>
            Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces and season with Italian seasoning
            and desired amount of salt and pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat butter in a large pot over medium heat until melted. Add the
            chicken and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.
            Remove and set aside. Note: This step is not needed if using a
            cooked rotisserie chicken.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the chicken broth, olive oil, and rice to the pot and bring to a
            boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.
          </li>
          <li>Cover tightly and cook for 6 minutes.</li>
          <li>
            Add the broccoli and replace the cover. Cook for 9 more minutes, or
            until no liquid remains in the pot and the rice is cooked through.
            (If it's not cooked through yet, quickly replace lid and simmer 5
            more minutes, or until cooked through.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn off the heat and leave the cover on. Let the rice stand for 10
            minutes, do not stir. Any rice on the bottom of the pot will
            release.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the cooked chicken, cream of chicken soup, milk, sour cream,
            optional seasonings, and half of the cheddar cheese to the pot of
            rice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add to a lightly greased 9 x 13 casserole dish and top with
            remaining cheese.
          </li>
          <li>Cover and bake for 15 minutes.</li>
